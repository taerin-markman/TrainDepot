  "description": "Automatically clones trains at new advanced train stations called train depots. The train to clone is set by a circuit network signal sent to the station. Clones schedule and filter settings as well as the carriages. Also adds a combinator that, when placed next to a train stop, will send a circuit network signal counting the number of trains scheduled for that station name."
